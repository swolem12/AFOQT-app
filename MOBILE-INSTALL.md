## Troubleshooting

### "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" option is missing

**On Android:**
- Make sure you're using Chrome or Edge
- Wait a few seconds after the page loads
- Check that you're visiting via HTTPS (not HTTP)
- Try tapping the three-dot menu (⋮) and look for "Install app"

**On iPhone:**
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome)
- Use the Share button (square with up arrow)
- Scroll down in the share sheet to find "Add to Home Screen"

### App doesn't work offline

- Visit the app at least once while online to cache the files
- Check that you have enough storage space on your device
- Make sure you didn't clear your browser cache immediately after installing

### App icon doesn't appear

- Check your app drawer or home screen pages
- On Android, it might be in the app drawer instead of the home screen
- Try the installation process again

### App looks different than website

- This is normal! The installed app runs in fullscreen mode without browser UI
- This makes it feel more like a native app
